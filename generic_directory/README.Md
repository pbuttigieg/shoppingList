# generic_directory README

This README should explain - in enough detail for others with no prior exposure to this code (except for your top-level READMEs) to understand - what the code in this directory and sub-directory does and how to use it. 

Very detailed execution documentation (e.g. R or Jupyter Notebooks, calling/sourcing code in external files) should be in the /documentation subdirectory of this directory.
