# generic_subdirectory README

This README should briefly add details to anything written in the generic_directory README.Md. You don't have to repeat yourself, but you have to make sure that someone else exploring this repo knows what's going on. 

Cross-references to relevant files in the ../documentation folder in the generic_directory should be made as appropriate.
