# Documentation

Here, you should include all .Md files, R/Jupyter notebooks, and other narrative pieces that explain exactly how to reproduce your results using the code in this directory (cross-referencing other directories as needed). 

Good documentation should be intelligible and helpful up to 10 years after the project is done. These are *not*  rough notes, but part of your professional obligation to ensure reproducibility. 

@Managers: if the documentation is not sufficient for a third-party to reproduce the results in the repo, do not sign the end-of-employment release forms until it is.
