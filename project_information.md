# Publicly available data archives

This section should include references to ***absolutely all*** the data that someone would need to run the code in this repository. 

@Managers: If anything is missing and some code cannot be run, this is not a valid scientific archive and personnel end-of-employment papers should not be signed until it is resolved.

projectDataArchiveIri: [e.g. an INSDC DOI]

# Other data archives

This should not be necessary except in very rare circumstances when/where you are dealing with sensitive data (e.g. personal data under GPDR, militarily sensitive data, indigenous data under OCAP, etc) that cannot be released to the public. This section should describe where that data is and the appropriate path to acquiring it, respecting relevant clearance structures.
